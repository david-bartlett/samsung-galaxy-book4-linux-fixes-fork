# Fix: Samsung Galaxy Book3/Book4 Webcam (Intel IPU6 / OV02C10 / libcamera)

> **Recommended webcam fix for Galaxy Book3 and Book4.** Uses the open-source libcamera stack with PipeWire. Supports **Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch-based distros**. Includes an on-demand camera relay for apps that don't support PipeWire (Zoom, OBS, VLC) with near-zero idle CPU usage. The installer auto-detects your distro.

> **Galaxy Book5 (Lunar Lake / IPU7):** Use [webcam-fix-book5](../webcam-fix-book5/) instead — the installer will detect Lunar Lake and direct you there.

**Tested on:** Samsung Galaxy Book4 Ultra, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Kernel 6.17.0-14-generic (HWE)
**Date:** February 2026
**Hardware:** Intel IPU6 (Meteor Lake `8086:7d19` or Raptor Lake `8086:a75d`), OV02C10 sensor (`OVTI02C1`), Intel Visual Sensing Controller (IVSC)

## Quick Install

**No git?** Download, install, and reboot in one step:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/Andycodeman/samsung-galaxy-book4-linux-fixes/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz | tar xz && cd samsung-galaxy-book4-linux-fixes-main/webcam-fix-libcamera && ./install.sh && sudo reboot
```

**Already cloned?**

```bash
./install.sh

The on-demand camera relay for non-PipeWire apps (Zoom, OBS, VLC) is automatically enabled during install and starts on login with near-zero idle CPU usage.

---

## How It Works

The fix uses the open-source libcamera Simple pipeline handler with Software ISP, accessed through PipeWire. An on-demand camera relay provides a standard V4L2 device for apps that don't support PipeWire:

```
IVSC firmware  →  OV02C10 sensor  →  IPU6 ISYS  →  libcamera  →  PipeWire  →  Apps
(mei-vsc, ivsc-*)   (kernel driver)    (kernel)      (Simple ISP)   (pipewire-    (Firefox,
                                                                      libcamera)    Chromium, etc.)
                                                                         ↓
                                                                 camera-relay (on-demand)
                                                                 libcamerasrc → v4l2loopback
                                                                         ↓
                                                                 /dev/videoX (V4L2)  →  Zoom, OBS, VLC
```

**PipeWire-native apps** (Firefox, Chromium, GNOME Camera) access the camera directly through PipeWire's libcamera SPA plugin — no relay needed.

**Non-PipeWire apps** (Zoom, OBS, VLC) access the camera through the on-demand V4L2 relay. The relay uses **near-zero CPU when idle** — it monitors the v4l2loopback device for client connections using kernel V4L2 events, and only starts the GStreamer pipeline when an app opens the device. When the app closes, the pipeline stops automatically.

### On-Demand Camera Relay

The camera relay is an event-driven bridge between libcamera and V4L2:

- **Idle state:** A lightweight C monitor (`camera-relay-monitor`) holds the v4l2loopback device open and writes black frames to keep it in a ready state. Uses ~0 CPU.
- **App opens device:** The monitor detects the V4L2 client event and signals the relay to start a GStreamer pipeline: `libcamerasrc → videoflip method=none → videoconvert → v4l2sink`.
- **App closes device:** The monitor detects the disconnect and the pipeline stops. The camera LED turns off.
- **`videoflip method=none`:** Forces a CPU buffer copy — required because libcamera 0.7.0's GPU ISP produces DMA-BUF buffers that read as zeros through v4l2loopback's mmap interface.

To manage the relay:

```bash
camera-relay status          # Show current state
camera-relay start               # Start relay (always-on, foreground)
camera-relay start --on-demand   # Start on-demand mode (idle until app opens device)
camera-relay stop            # Stop relay
camera-relay enable-persistent   # Enable on-demand mode at login (recommended)
camera-relay disable-persistent  # Disable auto-start
```

A system tray icon is also available for GUI control.

## What the Installer Does

The install script performs these steps:

1. **Detects distro** (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch) and hardware (IPU6 Meteor Lake or Raptor Lake)
2. **Checks kernel version** (6.10+ required for IPU6 ISYS driver)
3. **Verifies kernel modules** (IVSC, IPU6, OV02C10)
4. **Checks sensor probe status** — detects the 26 MHz external clock issue (some Book3/Book4 Ultra with Raptor Lake) and offers to auto-install the [DKMS fix](../ov02c10-26mhz-fix/)
5. **Loads IVSC modules** and adds them to initramfs (fixes the boot race condition where the OV02C10 sensor probes before IVSC is ready)
6. **Installs libcamera** (from repos on Fedora/Arch, builds from source on Ubuntu)
7. **Installs PipeWire libcamera plugin** (rebuilds SPA plugin on Ubuntu if needed)
8. **Installs sensor tuning file** (`ov02c10.yaml` with color correction matrix)
9. **Hides raw IPU6 V4L2 nodes** (udev rules + WirePlumber rules to prevent ~48 unusable "ipu6" entries in app camera lists)
10. **Installs camera relay** (v4l2loopback, GStreamer plugin, on-demand monitor, CLI tool, systray GUI)
11. **Restarts PipeWire** and verifies the camera is detected

## Supported Hardware

This fix works for any laptop with:
- Intel IPU6 on **Meteor Lake** (PCI ID `8086:7d19`) or **Raptor Lake** (PCI ID `8086:a75d`)
- **OV02C10** camera sensor (`OVTI02C1`)
- **Linux** with kernel 6.10+

This includes Samsung Galaxy Book3, Book4 Ultra, Book4 Pro, Book4 Pro 360, and possibly other laptops with the same IPU6 + OV02C10 combination (Dell, Lenovo, etc.). The core issue — IVSC modules not auto-loading — is not Samsung-specific.

**Not supported:** Galaxy Book5 (Lunar Lake / IPU7) — use [webcam-fix-book5](../webcam-fix-book5/) instead.

## Supported Distros

| Distro | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Ubuntu / Ubuntu-based** | Supported | Builds libcamera from source if system version is too old |
| **Fedora** | Supported | libcamera from repos |
| **Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro** | Supported | libcamera from repos |

---

## Known App Issues

### Cheese -- Crashes (standalone fix available)

GNOME Cheese crashes with a segfault (`SIGSEGV` in `libgstvideoconvertscale.so`) when receiving frames from the v4l2loopback device. This is a Cheese/Clutter bug, not a camera issue.

A standalone fix is available:
```bash
cd camera-relay && ./cheese-fix.sh       # Install
cd camera-relay && ./cheese-fix-uninstall.sh  # Uninstall
```

### GNOME Camera (snapshot) -- May crash on some systems

GNOME Camera may crash with `SIGSEGV` in `gst_video_frame_copy_plane`. **Workaround:** `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 snapshot`

### What works

The webcam works correctly with: **Firefox**, **Chrome/Chromium/Brave**, **Zoom**, **Microsoft Teams**, **OBS Studio**, **mpv**, **VLC**, and most other apps.

### Browser & App Compatibility

With `exclusive_caps=0` (the default), browsers work best using V4L2 directly through the camera relay, without PipeWire camera flags:

| App | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **Firefox** | Working | Works via PipeWire (no flags needed) |
| **Chrome** | Working | Works via V4L2 camera relay. PipeWire flag optional but can cause issues. |
| **Chromium** | Working | Same as Chrome |
| **Brave** | Working | Same as Chrome |
| **Edge** | Working | Works via V4L2 camera relay only. No PipeWire support. |
| **Zoom** | Working | Uses V4L2 camera relay |
| **OBS Studio** | Working | Uses V4L2 camera relay |
| **VLC** | Working | Uses V4L2 camera relay |
| **Cheese** | Crashes | Use standalone fix: `cd ../camera-relay && ./cheese-fix.sh` |
| **GNOME Camera** | May crash | Workaround: `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 snapshot` |

**Note:** The PipeWire camera flag (`chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-pipewire-camera`) is **not recommended** — community testing found it can prevent Chromium browsers from seeing the camera, and Edge doesn't support it at all. Browsers work reliably through the V4L2 camera relay without this flag.

Quick test:
```bash
# PipeWire-native test
gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc ! videoconvert ! autovideosink

# V4L2 test (requires camera-relay running)
mpv av://v4l2:/dev/video0 --profile=low-latency --untimed --no-correct-pts
```

## Tips

### Low-latency video preview with mpv / ffplay

By default, `mpv` and `ffplay` buffer video frames which adds ~2 seconds of lag. Use these flags for real-time preview:

```bash
mpv av://v4l2:/dev/video0 --profile=low-latency --untimed --no-correct-pts
ffplay -f video4linux2 -tune zerolatency -vf "setpts=0" /dev/video0
```

The `--no-correct-pts` flag tells MPV to ignore v4l2loopback frame timestamps, which prevents stutter and a cosmetic timer drift on some distros (notably Fedora with v4l2loopback 0.15.x).

Replace `/dev/video0` with your camera device (e.g. `/dev/video32` for the relay). VLC and Zoom don't need these flags — they handle latency correctly by default.

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not detected after reboot

Check that IVSC modules loaded:
```bash
lsmod | grep -E 'ivsc|mei.vsc'
```

If missing, verify they're in the initramfs:
```bash
# Ubuntu
lsinitramfs /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) | grep -E "ivsc|mei.vsc"
# Fedora
lsinitrd | grep -E "ivsc|mei.vsc"
```

### Installer says "kernel modules couldn't be found" (`mei-vsc`, `ivsc-csi`, …)

On most systems the IVSC bridge is shipped as loadable modules (`mei-vsc`,
`mei-vsc-hw`, `ivsc-ace`, `ivsc-csi`). On Ubuntu install
`linux-modules-ipu6-generic-hwe-24.04` (match your HWE variant); on Fedora
`sudo dnf install kernel-modules-extra kernel-modules`.

Some recent kernels (e.g. Fedora kernel 7.x) build the IVSC bridge **into the
kernel** or ship it under a consolidated module name, so there is no `.ko` file
to find — the installer now treats a module as present if it's built-in or
discoverable via `modinfo`. If you still hit the warning and the camera works
after a reboot, it's harmless; you can also re-run with `--skip-module-check`.
To check what your kernel actually provides:
```bash
find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -iname '*vsc*'
modinfo mei_vsc ivsc_csi ivsc_ace 2>&1 | head
grep -i vsc /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.builtin
```

### "external clock 26000000 is not supported" in dmesg

Some Galaxy Book3/Book4 Ultra models (Raptor Lake) have a 26 MHz external clock instead of the expected 19.2 MHz. The installer detects this automatically and offers to install the [DKMS-patched ov02c10 driver](../ov02c10-26mhz-fix/). If you skipped the prompt during install, run the fix manually:
```bash
cd ov02c10-26mhz-fix && sudo ./install.sh
```

### Too many "ipu6" entries in camera list

Log out and back in for the udev rules and WirePlumber config to take effect. The rules hide raw IPU6 V4L2 nodes so only the libcamera source and Camera Relay appear.

### Zoom / OBS / VLC don't see the camera

Enable the on-demand camera relay:
```bash
camera-relay enable-persistent
```

### Chromium browser doesn't show camera

Chrome/Chromium/Brave/Edge should see the camera through the V4L2 camera relay without any special flags. Make sure the relay is running:
```bash
camera-relay status
camera-relay enable-persistent --yes  # if not enabled
```

If the camera still doesn't appear, you can try enabling `chrome://flags/#enable-webrtc-pipewire-camera` — but note this flag can break camera access in some browsers (especially Edge). Disable it if it causes problems.

### Black screen in apps / "v4l2loopback ... não é um dispositivo de saída"

On Ubuntu/Zorin (Noble base) the pre-installed **Intel OEM camera stack**
(`v4l2-relayd` + `ipu6-camera-*`) ships its own
`/etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf` with `exclusive_caps=1
card_label="Intel MIPI Camera"` and an enabled `v4l2-relayd.service` that
loads v4l2loopback at boot. Because modprobe.d files merge in lexical order
and the **last** value of a duplicate key wins, that file overrides the
relay's `99-camera-relay-loopback.conf`, so the loopback comes up
**capture-only** (no `VIDEO_OUTPUT`). GStreamer's `v4l2sink` then can't write
into it and apps show a black screen, often with
`O dispositivo "/dev/videoN" não é um dispositivo de saída`.

Check for it:
```bash
lsmod | grep v4l2loopback
cat /sys/module/v4l2loopback/parameters/exclusive_caps   # Y = wrong
systemctl status v4l2-relayd
```

The installer now detects and **neutralizes** this automatically — it stops,
disables and masks `v4l2-relayd.service` and moves the OEM
`/etc/modprobe.d/v4l2loopback.conf` aside (restored by `uninstall.sh`). Just
re-run `sudo bash install.sh` and reboot. The change is fully reversible:
`uninstall.sh` restores the OEM file and re-enables the service.

### Desaturated, green-tinted or purple image (colour tuning)

The bundled `ov02c10.yaml` ships a conservative colour-correction matrix (CCM).
It is **not** a full sensor calibration, so depending on your panel and lighting
the image can still read green/cool (most common) or, on models where the sensor
is mounted upside-down, purple/magenta. You can tune the CCM yourself.

The easy way — an interactive tuner that cycles through presets with a live
preview and writes the one you pick to every copy of the tuning file:
```bash
cd webcam-fix-libcamera
./tune-ccm.sh
```

To do it by hand, edit the matrix in `ov02c10.yaml` (rows should each sum to
~1.0 so neutral greys stay neutral) — but see the next entry first, because hand
edits often *look* like they do nothing.

### Editing `ov02c10.yaml` has no effect

Two things bite people here:

1. **The tuning file is read once, when the camera is opened.** `camera-relay`
   and PipeWire keep a libcamera instance alive, so an edit isn't picked up until
   they're restarted (or you reboot):
   ```bash
   systemctl --user restart camera-relay.service pipewire.service wireplumber.service
   ```
   Then close and reopen the app you're testing with. `./tune-ccm.sh` does this
   for you.

2. **There can be two copies of the file.** The distro one is at
   `/usr/share/libcamera/ipa/simple/ov02c10.yaml`; if libcamera was built from
   source (the installer does this on Ubuntu, and on any distro with
   `--force-libcamera-rebuild`) there's a second copy at
   `/usr/local/share/libcamera/ipa/simple/ov02c10.yaml`. Whichever libcamera is
   actually loaded reads *its own* copy — edit the wrong one and nothing changes.
   Check which file is in use:
   ```bash
   LIBCAMERA_LOG_LEVELS=IPAProxy:INFO cam -c1 -C1 2>&1 | grep -i "tuning file"
   ```
   Edit the path it prints, or edit both, or just use `./tune-ccm.sh` (it writes
   to all of them).

If no matrix you try makes any difference and you also see this in the log:
```
WARN IPASoft soft_simple.cpp:... IPASoft: Failed to create camera sensor helper for ov02c10
```
then your libcamera doesn't have the OV02C10 sensor helper, so auto-exposure and
auto-white-balance fall back to a generic path and the colours will be wrong no
matter what the CCM says. Rebuild libcamera with the helper patched in:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh --force-libcamera-rebuild
```

> **Note (Arch/Fedora):** `cam` and `qcam` may keep printing the
> "Failed to create camera sensor helper" warning *even after* a successful
> `--force-libcamera-rebuild`. Those tools load the distro's packaged libcamera
> (its `.so` is a higher patch version, so the dynamic linker prefers it), not
> the patched build in `/usr/local`. The **camera relay** runs its pipeline with
> `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib`, so it *does* use the patched build — which is
> what every app that goes through the relay (Firefox, Chrome, Zoom, OBS, VLC,
> mpv, …) actually sees. Apps that talk to libcamera directly without the relay
> (`cam`, `qcam`, GNOME Snapshot, Chromium with the `enable-webrtc-pipewire-camera`
> flag) are the exception and may still get the unpatched system libcamera on
> those distros. To confirm the *relay* picked up the patched build:
> ```bash
> camera-relay status
> journalctl --user -u camera-relay -b | grep -i 'libcamera\|GStreamer plugin'
> ```

### Camera upside-down after running `cam` or `qcam`

Opening the sensor directly with `cam`/`qcam` resets the V4L2 flip controls when
it exits. A relay that's already streaming doesn't re-apply them, so on models
with an inverted sensor (e.g. Galaxy Book3 Ultra 960XFH) the relay's image ends
up upside-down until you restart it:
```bash
systemctl --user restart camera-relay.service
```
Avoid poking the camera with `cam`/`qcam` while the relay is running.

## Legacy Webcam Fix

There is an older webcam fix in [`webcam-fix/`](../webcam-fix/) that uses Intel's proprietary camera HAL (`icamerasrc`) with `v4l2-relayd`. **This is not recommended** — it's kept only as a fallback if the libcamera stack doesn't work on your hardware. The libcamera fix is open-source, supports more distros, and includes on-demand activation with near-zero idle CPU.
